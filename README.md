# Web Development Internship - Task 14
## Login UI Using LocalStorage (Frontend Only)

### Project Description
This project demonstrates a basic authentication flow using only frontend technologies. It utilizes HTML and CSS for the user interface and JavaScript with the LocalStorage API to manage user registration, login validation, and session persistence.

### Features
* **Dual UI:** Includes both Registration and Login forms within a single-page interface.
* **Data Persistence:** User credentials are captured via form handling and stored in `LocalStorage`.
* **Credential Validation:** Compares user input against stored values to grant or deny access.
* **Session Management:** Implements a login state that persists across page refreshes.
* **Protected Route:** Restricts access to a "Dashboard" section unless the user is authenticated.
* **Logout Functionality:** Provides a way to clear session data and redirect the user back to the login screen.
* **Dynamic Feedback:** Displays success and error messages based on validation results.
